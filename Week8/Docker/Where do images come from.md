- You can list the local images using the command: *docker images ls*
- When an image is published to a registry , its name must be:
```
repository_name>/<name>:<tag>

```

- tag is optional; when missing, it is considered to be latest by default - 
- repository_name can be a registry DNS or the name of a registry in the Docker Hub
